BZFPS
=====

Free and open source battlezone-like first person shooter (hence the name BZFPS)

This project is some sort of an experiment on minimalism with libraries,
resources, code, and even gameplay, while still being a fun game (hopefully).

## Prerequisites ##
Don't worry, you probably already have these installed ;)

  * X11
  * OpenGL
  * OpenAL
  * ALUT (OpenAL Utility Toolkit, usually provided with OpenAL, or with freealut)

## Compiling ##
Currently, the best way to compile and run is to import this project in Eclipse
and compile/run from there

## Running ##
See section above.
